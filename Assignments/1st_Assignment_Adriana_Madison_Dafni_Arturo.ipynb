    "1. Compute the posterior pdf, and both prior and posterior predictor pmf for the placenta previa problem, using a conjugate $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ prior, for several values of the parameters, obtaining for each of them a 95% (centered) credible interval and the MAP and posterior expectation estimators of $\\theta$. In particular, reproduce Figure 2.3 and Table 2.1 in BDA3 [1]. Do the same for those $\\alpha_0$ and $\\beta_0$ such that $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha_0,\\beta_0)$ has the same expectation and variance than the piecewise linear nonconjugate prior. Compare the posterior quantities with both priors. \n",

    "2. Simulate the prior predictive pmf with the nonconjugate piecewise linear pdf. Do it in both possible ways: (1) Sample from $h$ by the inverse transformation method and (2) Sample from its discretization. Summarize the resulting simulated sample: plot the empirical pmf, compute median, mode, expectation, standard deviation. Compare the results with those obtained from the conjugate prior $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha_0,\\beta_0)$. \n",

Sample from the the discretization of the posterior pdf as in Exercise 1. Summarize the resulting simulated sample: plot the empirical pmf, compute median, mode, expectation, standard deviation. Compare the results with those obtained from the conjugate prior $\\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha_0,\\beta_0)$.\n",
